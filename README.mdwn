KVFS
====

KVFS is a key-value-file-system.
It is my exploration into file-systems and distributed systems.

On top of a python-dict-like-object it
implements a hierarchical keystore.
On top of that a file system with metadata.
On top of that a Fuse filesystem.

As python-dict-like-object a dict can be used,
but also a bsddb or the included scalaris-dict,
which can connect to a Scalaris db.
